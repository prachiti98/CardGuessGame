# Ace It

Introducing AceIt - a thrilling card game where you hunt for the ace in 5 rounds! Use two tries per round and bet points wisely. Hints eliminate half the cards but only payout 1.5x your bet. Guessing the ace yourself earns 2x your bet. Reach 200 points to win! 


# Rules:
1. Players must find the ace among six cards in each round using two tries.
2. The game incorporates elements of chance with the option to bet points and use hints to eliminate half the cards.
3. Player cant place a bet more than 50. 
4. Using hints makes the game more accessible, but players cannot win if they use hints in all five rounds.
5. To win, players must accumulate 200 points in five rounds, earning 1.5x their bet if they use hints, but 2x their bet if they guess the ace themselves.
6. AceIt is a fun and challenging game that can be played with friends and family, offering a great way to pass the time and test your skills!
